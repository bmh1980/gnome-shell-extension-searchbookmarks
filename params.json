Since my first Linux I was a passionate GNOME user (at that time 1.4). I loved the immense changes to GNOME 2. The changes to GNOME 3, I found after a short familiarization fantastic.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this ended with the introduction of CSD. I can not and will not get used to it. Neither visually nor in terms of the handling. CSD I feel as a disaster. A complete maldevelopment from the whole concept.\r\n\r\nIt is just not acceptable that the GNOME developers think that my desktop is too small to represent windows with a menu and title bar. I decide it, not some developers!\r\n\r\nOf course, I can imagine in which direction GNOME is developed today. For this, the similarity between Epiphany and a web browser on Android is already too large. But then the GNOME developers should say so openly and honestly. GNOME is, in my opinion, no longer thought of as a desktop.\r\n\r\nI find it very regrettable, but I can no longer feel very well with GNOME. That's why I now leave GNOME and no longer develop my extensions on.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to continue to develop, I'll be happy to transfer the repo.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
